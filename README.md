# oh-my-zsh Customizations by PEP

I once had a repo forked form https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/ , but since Mr. Russell no longer accepts new themes, that repo remains unmerged into upstream. (For the record: I *don't* blame him.)

Maintaining a full forked repo is a bit too effort-intensive, though, as I have to keep updating to Mr. Russel's then push to my forked repo.

So, I deleted that repo, and created this _JUST_ for the `custom/` directory of `oh-my-zsh`

## Contents

This repo contains **custom** plugins & themes that had been unmerged into `oh-my-zsh` upstream repo.

## Installation

1. Install `oh-my-zsh` as usual
2. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh`
3. `rm -rf custom`
4. `git clone --recurse-submodules $THIS_REPOSITORY custom`
5. ...
6. Profit!!! :D
